0.1.8 - Improved Options
------------------------------
  New optional syntax:
  
    restartr -c [cmd] [file1] [file2] ...
    
  If you want to pass some args to the child process:
  
    restartr -c [cmd] -a [arg1] -a [arg2] [file1] ... [fileN]
  
  You may still use the old syntax:
  
    restartr [cmd] [arg] [file1] ... [fileN]
    
  New Features:
    You can now order the arguments however you'd like.
    You can also now have 0-n arguments for the child process.

  New Dependencies:
    optimist 0.0.3 (will be installed when you `npm install restartr`)
